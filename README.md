# Clustering

K-means is an **unsupervised** partitioning algorithm. It's used to organize unlabeled data into groups or clusters.
In this project, I used the Palmer penguins dataset, to group and cluster different penguins' species, used their features, so that i can categorize the new penguins' category, based on its features;
**Note:** As we may know, since unsupervised learning, does not predict anything; in other words, it is not a process about making predictions, we can not use the *Evaluation metrics.* Instead, for being sure of making the right categories, we use Silhouette Score, which is a tool for assessing the appropriateness of clustering results by providing a quantitative measure of how well-defined and distinct the clusters are.
At the end, we can discover, that our data is categorized in six groups or clusters.
